# TwiTwi API
This is an API for [TwiTwi](https://github.com/Pittan/twitwi).  
Or you can use just for accessing Twitter APIs directly from your browser easilly.  
e.g. Using this for hackathon is very useful for this.  

Currently, only the `statuses/lookup` API is available.  

You can deploy your own API instantly using heroku now!  
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Or, you can just build a local server using nodejs.

# Before you use
This API is made for a prototype usage.  
Using this for hackathon may be boost your idea without thinking about server side APIs.  
Please note that I do not take any responsibility or liability for any damage or loss caused through this code.

# APIs
## `GET statuses/lookup`

- Under construction. PRs are accepted!!

## Requirements
- heroku account  
- Your own Twitter App (It can be created on Twitter Dev site.)  

## How to use TwiTwi API
### 1. Create your own twitter App and make your access token / access secrets.
It doesn't have a authentication mechanism for now on.  
So **I Strongly recommend to make your Twitter app permission to "Read only".**  
It can't write any tweets, so you're account are safe :grinning:  
Although I think it is safe to create an account for that application newly.

### 2. Deploy to heroku
### 3. Set environment key
### 4. Done, ready to go!
